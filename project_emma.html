          <h1>Emma</h1>
          <p> Emma is a mobile health and wellness app that is designed for women to make therapy more accessible and simple by connecting users with mental health professionals for online therapy sessions. </p>

          <div>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
              <span>I was responsible for the product design part of Emma, including User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI).</span>
              <span> Tools used: Figma, Adobe Photoshop, User Testing, Usability Hub, FlowMapp, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Procreate</span>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>Taking care of one's mental health through therapy has become more normalized in recent years. However, not everyone enjoys the idea of attending therapy in person due to factors like the exhausting search for the right therapist and the time spent en route. While many people can benefit from therapy, it may not be accessible to everyone.</p>
            <p>Emma's purpose is to provide a platform for users to <span> access therapy in their own homes and minimize the effort, time and stress while receiving the service and care they need.</span>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Hypotheses</h3>
            <p>Assuming our users are women ranging from 18~55, varying in career and life stages, have previously little to no experience with therapy, and want to take care of their mental health by potentially working with therapists. Based on our potential user profile, we hypothesized their top needs and goals: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a>Ease and efficiency in the searching/filtering process to find the right therapist</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a>Flexibility in switching therapists and communication methods</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a>Transparency through therapist reviews from other users</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a>A safe space to connect with other women who are going through similar situations</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>With these hypotheses in mind, I interviewed 5 potential users and assessed the results to make user personas that reflect needs of potential users. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>User Interview</h3>
            <p>I interviewed five participants who fit our user profile to seek their experience with similar products and perspectives. The participants were between the ages of 21 and 32 and were dispersed in different parts of the world. The interviews were conducted via video chat and each took approximately 25 minutes. We discussed their mental health habits, experience with and attitude towards therapy. I also asked about what they prioritize in mobile apps and what make them choose one over another. </p>
            <p>The interviews validated the hypotheses I laid out in the beginning. Besides that, I also found that clarity and simplicity in layout design and user privacy protection are integral to whether they would use such an app. A common gap in the users for a product like this is insufficient trust because people tend to see therapy existing in traditional settings only. </p>

          <div>
            <h3> User Personas </h3>
            <p> With the interview results and analysis, I created three user personas to understand and solve the problems various users could encounter ranging from ages 26 to 49. Their primary roles range from a young professional, to a new mother and a coporate senior level professional in her 40s. Their frustrations and priorities align with their roles in different life stages: work, relationships, motherhood, and aging. </p> *IMAGE HERE*
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>User Journey</h3>
            <p>Based on the varied personas and their needs, I created their user journeys accordingly in achieving the shared end goal, being booking an online session with a therapist.</p>
            <p>From the interview, I uncovered the different perspectives and concerns the users have for each step along the way. There is a lack of prior experience in online therapy among the users; building their trust through effectively reaching user goals and being informative about the experts is significant. </p>
            <p>For instance, when selecting an expert, Joey, who already feels burned out from work wants the app to help her narrow down the right therapist and have their detailed bio so she can make an easy selection. On the other hand, Audrey’s concern over a therapist’s expertise and reviews exceeds her concern over efficiency as her priority is finding a trustworthy therapist. </p>

          <div>
            <h3>User Flow</h3>
            <p>I made different user maps for our personas to accommodate their needs. For instance, Joey is a young professional and wants to relieve her stress in her new role by talking to a professional. After signing up for an account and onboarding, she will find a suitable therapist by the categories of challenges, filter through the therapists to find the right one, and book an appointment.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Audrey finds reviews of therapists helpful when selecting a therapist. Therefore, being able to view ratings while browsing, rank therapists by ratings, and allow users to read detailed reviews will be essential for users like Audrey.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>Initial Wireframes</h3>
            <p>From different categories or based on user preferences, users can find therapists of their choice and make more informed decisions about who to work with. </p>
            <p>The goal was for users to find the most fitting expert in an organized manner, have access to the crucial information they need about the experts, and be able to book an appointment stress-free.</p>
            <p>During this process, I also administrated an online card-sorting session with five participants to receive feedback on the app's structure, layout and navigation system. </p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Usabiilty Testing</h3>
            <p> I conducted usability tests on the wireframes and mid-fidelity prototype with five participants. Due to a limited budget, the participants were recruited on social media. The tests were conducted by the moderated remote method to observe the participants' impressions, receive prompt feedback, and for me to answer any questions they have during the session. </p>
            <p>The objectives for the tests were to ensure that the primary user flows are smooth and efficient and that the app's main functions are intuitive and easy to use. The functions we tested were: <span> 1. onboarding + sign up 2. booking a therapist 3. joining a community. </span>
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>The Iterative Process</h3>
            <p>Many changes were made continuously as usability tests were conducted. I fixed the primary issues discovered from the tests and made additional iterations. I also conducted additional A/B preference tests for the home page and the categories page which improved the usability and coherence of the design.</p>
            <p>Overall, structurally, we reorganized the layout of the pages and made the passages to each user goal smoother and more efficient. We also added, deleted and moved around certain buttons and icons to improve usability.</p>
            <p>Visually, the pallet was switched from an ecstatic style to a tender and muted one to align with Emma's vision to provide a space where users feel safe and calm. We adopted round corners throughout the app to accentuate the soft and feminine vibe. </p>

            <h4>Booking A Therapy Session</h4>
            <p>The goal for Emma is to make therapy accessible for all women, embracing all backgrounds and needs.</p>
            <p> Users can find their therapist by category or by browsing through all therapists. They can also filter for therapists with specific attributes such as sex, ethnicity and religion. </p>
            <p>Booking appointments is made easy and stress-free as the entire process is online. There are also various ways to connect with therapists to accommodate users' habits. </p>

            <h4>Communties and Meaningful Connections</h4>
            <p>Users who share similar experiences can gather, start valuable discussions and support one another. Communities are a safe space for users to be open and vulnerable, to give and receive kindness from other women.</p>
